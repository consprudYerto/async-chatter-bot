Saint Paul Public Library is excited to announce that a new state-of-the-art Mobile Library is coming August 2024! Formerly known as the Bookmobile, the new replacement traveling library will offer an expanded and enhanced set of library services to neighborhoods across Saint Paul.

Services will pause March 31 while library staff transition from one vehicle to the next. During the pause in service, residents are encouraged to continue accessing library services through their nearest brick and mortar SPPL neighborhood library. The new Mobile Library is expected to hit the streets in early August 2024.
 
With the new vehicle offering more library services to the community, the name will change from Bookmobile to Mobile Library. The new name better reflects the breadth of service that is offered through the vehicle. It is also a more accessible name for people visiting the vehicle's stops, including newcomers to our city and people whose first language is not English.
 
Once fully decommissioned, like most city vehicles, the existing vehicle will go to auction. We will not be able to keep the current vehicle for additional outreach stops due to budget and maintenance constraints.
 
Instead of a 39-foot step van which is the current vehicle style, we will have a 32-foot straight truck. While slightly smaller, the new Mobile Library will have a different layout that will enhance the user experience inside the vehicle.
 
The MMU enables SJHS to meet the needs of individuals who may not have transportation or access to medical offices or clinics. With the MMU, we can also deliver corporate wellness to the doors of local organizations, providing health education and screenings on-site.
 
Local businesses have the option of scheduling the MMU to be onsite for their employees to access, including mobile mammograms. A reservation fee is associated with these corporate wellness programs. The MMU enables an organization to contribute to the health of their workforce, while eliminating the need for employees to leave work in order to receive similar services.
 
**All Breast Care Locations including the mobile coaches offer 3D Mammography** which is a new screening tool that allows doctors the ability to examine breast tissue one layer as time and:
 
**Partial breast radiation using Brachytherapy** allows a more directed dose of radiation and reduces the normal course of radiation for women with early-stage breast cancer by 83%, from 25-30 days of treatment down to only 5 days.
 
Many household products you use to clean your kitchen and bathroom, maintain your car and home, and control animals and insects contain hazardous materials. If a container has the words **caution**, **warning**, **danger** or **poison**on the label and still has product inside, it is considered hazardous and does not belong in the trash. Bring these items to Ramsey County's free household hazardous waste collection sites for safe disposal.
 
Gas cans and other fuel containers will not be returned at mobile collection sites. Pick them up later at our year-round collection site in Saint Paul or use that site directly when dropping of gasoline.
 
There is a 24/7 collection shed in Arden Hills that accepts used oil, oil filters and antifreeze. These items are also accepted at the year-round and mobile household hazardous waste collection sites.
